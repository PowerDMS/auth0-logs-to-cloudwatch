# Auth0 - Logs to CloudWatch

[![Auth0 Extensions](http://cdn.auth0.com/extensions/assets/badge.svg)](https://sandbox.it.auth0.com/api/run/auth0-extensions/extensions-badge?webtask_no_cache=1)

This extension will take all of your Auth0 logs and export them to CloudWatch.

## Installation

1. Open the Auth0 Dashboard for the tenant for which you wish to install this extension.
2. Click the 'Create Extension' button and provide the URL to [https://github.com/PowerDMS/auth0-logs-to-cloudwatch]().
3. Configure the extension with the AWS Access Key, AWS Secret Key, and Log Group Name (i.e. 'auth0') *
4. You can optionally filter log events in the configuration as well.  See the [Filters](#filters) section below.

\* Note: The AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Key are for the 'auth0_log_writer_svc' user in AWS IAM.

## Usage

Install the extension, and inspect your CloudWatch logs in the AWS Console! *

\* Note: Logs are collected by the extension every 5 minutes and submitted to CloudWatch. The timestamp in CloudWatch is the time that the logs were sent to CloudWatch. However, each log statement has the timestamp when the event occurred on Auth0.

## Filters

The `LOG_LEVEL` can be set to (setting it to a value will also send logs of a higher value):

 - `1`: Debug messages
 - `2`: Info messages
 - `3`: Errors
 - `4`: Critical errors

The `LOG_TYPES` filter can be set to:

- `s`: Success Login (level: 1)

- `api_limit`: Rate Limit On API (level: 4)
